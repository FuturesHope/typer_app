# typer_app
Exercise python time and pyplot modules

This app is a part of my learning lessons from Udemy.

The exercise requirements are: 

- Create an app to help user type faster. 
- Give user a word to type it five times
- collect data on typing timing on each cycle
- tell the user how many mistakes were made during the exercise
- show a chart with the typing speed evolution
